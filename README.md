# minecraft-skyblock-1.18.2
TL;DR i found a sweet spot in the world generation settings that make nicely seperated islands that are not vertically stacked and ugly

A minecraft 1.18.2 and later skyblock world generation datapack that improves upon the default floating_islands preset and adds some helper recipes for vanilla skyblock.
